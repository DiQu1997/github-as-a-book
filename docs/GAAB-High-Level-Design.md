## Introduction

**Repo as a Book** is an innovative tool designed to transform a Git repository into an interactive, educational, and navigable book. Its primary goal is to guide users—regardless of their prior knowledge of the repository—through the codebase, documentation, and development history in a structured and understandable manner. By presenting repository content as chapters and sections, the tool aims to make complex codebases accessible and facilitate learning and onboarding processes.

---

## System Architecture Overview

### High-Level Overview

The system architecture is composed of three main layers:

1. **Input Layer**: Handles the ingestion of Git repositories from various sources, authentication, and repository management.
2. **Processing Layer**: Performs analysis, parsing, content generation, and indexing of repository content.
3. **Presentation Layer**: Delivers an interactive web interface for users to explore the repository as a book, including search and navigation functionalities.

### Rationale Behind Architecture

- **Separation of Concerns**: Dividing the system into layers allows for modular development, testing, and maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Each layer can be scaled independently based on load and performance requirements.
- **Flexibility**: The architecture supports integration with additional services or expansion of functionalities in the future.
